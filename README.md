A small application that uses Django to store and serve files to a user.

I made this to learn more about Django, touch up on my CSS skills (not relying on Bootstrap this time!), and to just get some more experience building web apps under my belt.

Things it does:
* Store files
* Serve files
* Delete files
* Show file count
* Show recent files

Things I want to add in the future:
* User authentication
* File preview
* File type seperation (tab for docs, pics, etc.)
